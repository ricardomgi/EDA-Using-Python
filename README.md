NYC Reported Accidents - Exploratory Data Analysis
==================================================

This is an exploratory data analysis project using Python on the NYC reported accidents dataset. The dataset contains details for each accident reported in New York City, from January 2018 to August 2019. The dataset has been collected and maintained by the NYC government.

The objective of this project is to answer the following questions:

1.  How have the number of accidents fluctuated over the past year and a half? Have they increased over time?
2.  For any particular day, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?
3.  Are there more accidents on weekdays than weekends?
4.  What is the accidents count-to-area ratio per borough? Which boroughs have disproportionately large numbers of accidents for their size?
5.  For each borough, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?
6.  What are the top 5 causes of accidents in the city?
7.  What types of vehicles are most involved in accidents per borough?
8.  What types of vehicles are most involved in deaths?
9.  Which areas have more accidents involving injured/killed pedestrians and cyclists?

Data Description
----------------

The dataset contains the following information for each accident:

-   Date and time of the accident
-   Borough and precinct where the accident occurred
-   Number of people injured and killed
-   Cause of the accident (e.g. speeding, distracted driving, etc.)
-   Vehicle type involved in the accident (e.g. car, truck, bicycle, etc.)
-   Other details about the accident

The dataset is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from the NYC OpenData website.

Analysis
--------

The exploratory data analysis will be performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Geopandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The analysis will involve the following steps:

-   Data load
-   Data cleaning and preparation
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Data visualization

The analysis will focus on answering the above mentioned questions.

The results of the analysis will be presented in a Jupyter notebook, which will be made available on GitHub.

Conclusion
----------

The NYC reported accidents dataset provides valuable information that can help improve safety on the city's roads. Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can inform policy and decision-making in this area.
